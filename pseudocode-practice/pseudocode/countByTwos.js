// Version 1: Create a program that counts by twos from 0 to 100. Display the numbers to the user in the browser.

// Version 2: Your product manager wants to increase user engagement by considering user input. Your product manager wants this program to be based on the user's range of minimum and maximum numbers. Display the numbers to the user in the browser.
// Example: Given a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 10, the browser will display: 6, 8, 10


// 1. Make sure you fully understand the problem.
// Create a program that counts by twos from 0 to 100 and Display the numbers to the user in the browser. 


2. Look up any tools you might need.

write a function countByTwo which will return the number of 2s when counting from 0 to 100.

for loops needs to repeat code a fixed number of times.
for (var i=0; i<101; i++) {

}

a. intinalize the loop variable
b. condition
3. increment or decrement the loop variable 


3. Write down the inputs and outputs of the function.
4. List out the coding structures you might use (loops, variables, conditional statements).

5. Write comments describing what you are going to do.



6. Look it over and then write the code!

function name it. 
loop to loop throuhg 0-100
for loopprnt the resulting number to the user in the brower . document.wirte() or 
inside the code blovk for the loop, it must have a conditional statment

)

intinalize to start ConstantSourceNode conditon is true the loop will returnwhe nthe condition is falise, it will SVGPathSegClosePathincremanetaion
if i++ is used for incrementation, inside of the code block for the for loop, it mish have a onditional 
if the incrementation is i++, we need conditional statement.


input: ranege of number from 0 thrugh 100. 
output: all the even numbers printed 


lst the coding struture we mught usedfuction that requestAnimationFrameinside the function, we wil need a loopinside the loop we need a variable called i to start at 0
