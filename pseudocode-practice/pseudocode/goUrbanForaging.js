//Version 1: It is harvest season and plenty of edible plants abound in your neighborhood. Only problem is, you don't know what is edible at this time of year in the SF Bay Area. Create a program that considers the time of year, your location, your climate zone, and what plants are available to harvest. Display the results to the user like so:
// Month: [month1], [month2]
// Climate Zone: [a number]
// Plants: [plant1], [plant2], [plant3]

//Version 2: Your product manager wants users to be able to add specific locations for places to go foraging as a comment that displays in the browser like so:
// Edible Plants: [plant1], [plant2], [plant3]
// Location: [comment, such as "at the corner of 8th and Fruitvale"]
// Month: [month1], [month2]
