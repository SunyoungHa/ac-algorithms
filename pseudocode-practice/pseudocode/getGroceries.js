// Your household is running low on groceries.
// Version 1: Create a program that generates a list of groceries based on quantity and item in such a way: 
// [quantity] [item1]
// [quantity] [item2]
// etc.

// Version 2: Your product manager wants the program to take in each user's input of quantity and items. Create a program that links the user to each quantity and item. In other words, your program will take the requests of each person in your household and display this in the browser: 
// [User1's name]: [quantity] [item], [quantity] [item], etc.
// [User2's name]: [quantity] [item], [quantity] [item], etc.
