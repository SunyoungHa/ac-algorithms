# Problem-Solving Method

1. Understand the problem.

- Read or listen to the problem statement.
- What is the input?
- What is the output?

2. Make a plan to solve the problem.

- Use pictures, charts, graphs, systematic lists, objects.
- Act out the solution to help you devise a plan.
- In Computer Science, we call this plan an algorithm.

3. Carry out the plan.

- Once the plan is conceived and understood, follow it.
- If you have planned well, this is the easy part.

4. Review and reflect on how the problem was solved.

- Once the problem is solved, reflect on the plan that was used.

# Steps to Pseudocoding

1. Make sure you fully understand the problem.

2. Look up any tools you might need.

3. Write down the inputs and outputs of the function.

4. List out the coding structures you might use (loops, variables, conditional statements).

5. Write comments describing what you are going to do.

6. Look it over and then write the code!

# Pseudocoding Practice Exercises

Write pseudocode for the following programs (aka functions):

1. makePBJSandwich


2. getGroceries
3. countByTwos
4. goUrbanForaging
5. telephoneGame

The JS files have already been created for you in a "pseudocode" folder.

# BONUS: choose one program's pseudocode to write out the code!

In the "code" folder, we have created 2 starter files for you to model the naming convention for any pseudocode version you would like to flesh out in your code!
